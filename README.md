## Welcome

A repository for the Smart Calculator Lab, for the [RES course](https://github.com/wasadigi/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES) taught at the HEIG-VD.

For this lab, you will want to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository. This means that you will have **your own copy of the project hosted on Github**. You will be able to push your local commits to your fork (working in a team). I will be able to access your work.

When you have created the work, you will need to **clone it on your local machine** (make sure that you do not clone *this* repository, but your own fork!)

Make sure that you update the information just below with the names of the two students contributing to the repo.
